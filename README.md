### Project Description
A desktop-only JavaScript chaos simulator that fills your screen with fake desktop icons, buttons, sliders, tabs, floating emojis, and Malayalam meme audio all programmed to run away from your cursor like scared cockroaches. Every hover triggers animations, sounds, pop-ups, and trolling UI behaviors designed to make you laugh (or rage quit).

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People these days are catching buttons way too easily. Clicking ‚ÄúOK‚Äù has become boring. Nobody‚Äôs heart races when trying to close a window anymore. We needed to fix this ‚Äúfun shortage‚Äù in the clicking world.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made the buttons run. And the sliders slide themselves. And the checkboxes uncheck themselves. And we added random Malayalam movie dialogues and fake pop-ups just to make sure you‚Äôll never successfully click anything again.
